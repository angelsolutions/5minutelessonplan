# Test
The 5 minute lesson plan was developed by [Teacher Toolkit](http://teachertoolkit.me/) and enhanced further by us here at [Angel Solutions](http://www.angelssolutions.co.uk). You can now create, save, edit and print a 5 Minute Lesson Plan within [Perspective](http://www.angelsolutions.co.uk/products/perspective) with your own number of Learning Episodes or even your own sections. You can also use our new features which include adding plans to your favourites, tagging and making them available to a wider community.

You can access the 5 Minute Lesson Plan via [Perspective](http://www.angelsolutions.co.uk/products/perspective) and [Perspective Lite](http://www.angelsolutions.co.uk/products/perspective/lite). To do this, simply [log in](https://perspective.angelsolutions.co.uk/perspective/login.aspx) and hover your cursor over the **Tools** icon on your main navigation bar before selecting **5 Min Lesson Plan**. You can also see the 5 Minute Lesson Plan page via your Perspective dashboard. There are quick links to create or print plans, or a direct link to the main 5 Minute Lesson Plan area.

Once you have quite a number of plans appearing on your Homepage, then it may become necessary to use the Search Function. The Search bar can narrow down your plans based on their title, description, users or anything that they were tagged with. The search results also let you **Favourite**, **Copy** and **Download** plans that appear in the list at the click of a button!
